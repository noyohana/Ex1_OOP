n this project I build weighted undirected graph.

1.File list: node_info :interface that represent the set of operations applicable on a node (vertex) in weighted undirectional graph.

NodeInfo : class that implements "node_info" interface.

weighted_graph: interface that represent an undirectional weighted graph.

WGraph_DS :class that implements "weighted_graph" interface.

weighed_graph_algorithms:interface represents the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms(shrotest path,check if the graph is connected).

WGraph_Algo: class that implements "weighted_graph_algorithms" interface.
